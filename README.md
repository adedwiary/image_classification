# Image-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
***
* Classified images by training a Convolutional Nueral Network (CNN).
* Managed to receive a validation accuracy of over 93%.
* Used the Multiclass Weather Dataset.

## The Multiclass Weather Dataset
It includes 1100 images with the following labels:
|  Label	|    Description    |
--------- |-------------------| 
|0	      |  Cloudy      |
|1	      |  Rain          |
|2	      |  Shine         |
|3	      |  Sunrise            |

**The image below is an example of the different images in the dataset.**
